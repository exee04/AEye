# A.Eye  
A.Eye is an intelligent visual recognition system running on the Raspberry Pi 5 (RPi5), designed to assist in Braille detection and accessibility enhancement using computer vision.

---

## 📌 Overview  
A.Eye leverages advanced object detection models, including YOLOv8 by Ultralytics, to identify and process Braille characters from captured images. The system is built for efficiency and portability, taking advantage of the Raspberry Pi 5's capabilities and camera integration.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time Braille character detection
- Lightweight and optimized for Raspberry Pi 5
- Easy-to-use and extendable architecture
- Open-source dataset integration

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics)
- **Roboflow** (for dataset hosting)
- **Picamera2** (for RPi camera integration)
- **MediaPipe** (for gesture or interaction extensions)

---

## 📸 Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Camera Module (compatible with Picamera2)
- MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS
- Optional: Display module for visual output
